/// This is the interface to UserNotifications that is used to generate local notifications

/// We do not expect to operate on a particularly large scale.
/// So we just have one bulk scan operation that finds and reactivates all
/// the alarms that need it.
///
/// And we invoke this scan from appropriate places:
/// 1. when the app starts
/// 2. when the app comes into the foreground
/// 3. when a notification is delivered.
///
/// We don't bother with any local timers so if notifications are disabled
/// then alarms will stop reactivating.  Oh well.
